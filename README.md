#  Entry name

bifcore-sdk-nodejs,the interface between Spark Chain Network and underlying blockchain platform is provided through API call

## Functional characteristics

The BIF-Core-SDK provides interfaces such as Spark Chain-underlying blockchain platform public and private key pair generation, Spark Chain-underlying blockchain platform private key signature public key verification, account service, block service, transaction service, etc. through API calls. At the same time, it also provides interface use examples to illustrate that developers can call the SDK to easily and quickly generate fast access to the main chain of Spark Chain.Let developers can all use bifcore services more easily.

## Quick Start

  Create bifcore-sdk-nodejs instance:

```js
'use strict' 

const BIFCoreSDK = require('bifcore-sdk-nodejs');

const sdk = new BIFCoreSDK({
  host: 'http://test.bifcore.bitfactory.cn/'
});

```
